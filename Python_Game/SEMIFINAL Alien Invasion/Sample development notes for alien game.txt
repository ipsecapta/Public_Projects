A Sampling of questions, solutions and ideas I documented during development.

0. what does owner_ref=None do?

1. Hypothetically - if I wanted a different sprite for each type of alien bullet as well, Instead of setting a default to player, and instead of having an owner_level parameter as well, would I just have 5 types of owner? Player, alien1, alien2, alien3, boss alien? Or would there be a better way to do that when the time came?


2. What are these three lines doing:
  self.rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, width, height)
        self.rect.centerx = x
        self.rect.centery = y


3.What's the relationship between this line:
self.y = float(self.rect.y)
and this statement:
        self.rect.centery = y


4. Do I not need a color parameter as part of the bullet class? How will this statement: 
 pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, self.color, self.rect)
Know where to get self.color?
_______________________________

I'd like to just spawn my aliens their sprite height above the screen top, and then let them just begin their motion pattern and let that carry them onto the screen. 

What is the point of the line self.zig_down_speed = 0.5 + self.speed?

Below that, what is the line              


             self.base_x = 0.0 -i want each sprite at level 2 to start at a random x, at a y just off screen, and then begin its normal movement pattern. 
_______________________

I changed the following line:
            self.drift_change_interval = random.randint(40, 80) #ships will change direction erratically, but within certain limits.

So that it will hopefully accomplish an effect I want. 
Will this work?

Question about this:
 def check_edge_for_fleet(self):
            """Use true/false boolean to tell alien if it has hit edge of screen - for lv1 fleets"""
            if self.level != 1: #Have other aliens who do not move in fleets (lvl 2 and 3) ignore this instruction - they'll bounce on their own.
                return False
            if self.rect.right > self.settings.screen_width or self.rect.left <= 0:
                 return True
            return False

Will each return statement stop the function there; so that the final :return false: statement only gets called if neither if before it is triggered?

Figuring out about firing:

So:

Alien sprite (therefore alien.py) should own: “My internal timer says I’m ready to fire now.”

Game (therefore alien_game.py) should own: “Okay, since you want to fire, I’ll spawn a bullet for you.”

Alien level 3 movement: Inspect before typing into file.

First, equation to ensure they do not get stuck at edge or go out of bounds; explanations to all elements added.
 elif self.level == 3: 
            self.drift_timer += 1 #there is a "drift timer" that determines how long they continue in a direction before changing; here we increment it
            if self.drift_timer >=self.drift_change_interval: #if timer has reached the drift interval, it's time to change direction: 
                 self.vx, self.vy = self._alien3_vector_changer() #activate vector_changer to change direction
                 self.drift_change_interval = random.randint(40, 80) #set a new random change interval.
                 self.drift_timer = 0 #then reset the timer to zero, and it will now begin incrementing toward the interval chosen in prev. line.

            self.x += self.vx #increment x movement
            self.y += self.vy #increment y movement

            self.rect.x = int(self.x)#match x and y coordinates to enable placement. 
            self.rect.y = int(self.y)

            if self.rect.left < 0:  # next 5 lines are to keep the erratic pattern from sending our alien out of bounds.
                self.rect.left = 0
                self.x = float(self.rect.x)
                """self.vx, self.vy = self._alien3_vector_changer() #activate vector_changer to change direction
                self.drift_change_interval = random.randint(40, 80) #set a new random change interval.
                self.drift_timer = 0 #then reset the timer to zero, and it will now begin incrementing toward the interval chosen in prev. line."""
            if self.rect.right > self.settings.screen_width:
                self.rect.right = self.settings.screen_width
                self.x = float(self.rect.x)
                """self.vx, self.vy = self._alien3_vector_changer() #activate vector_changer to change direction
                self.drift_change_interval = random.randint(40, 80) #set a new random change interval.
                self.drift_timer = 0 #then reset the timer to zero, and it will now begin incrementing toward the interval chosen in prev. line."""


Now that I've edited it - will the lines in triple quotes work if i remove the triple quotes?


___________________________
How can I implement something for the zigzagging aliens, the level 2 ones, that will prevent them from spawning where they will get stuck next to the edge? i WILL HAVE TO limit the range of their spawning coordinates to leave space 1/2 the defined wave amplitude of the sine function for wave2 alien motion. 


__________________________________________
Do I need to destroy the temp 'tailor' aliens generated by the spawning functions? No, they will not gum up memory.

__________________________
Glitch: the program is spawning all levels of alien if I have more than one player, even if I have none set in the wave_master dictionary. Solution: current_wave_num was operating with a -1 at one point in the main file to match python's "start at zero" counting - but that had already been compensated for in the menu_helpers file, so we were starting on wave_master entry -1; the last one.


________________________________________________
Random features not yet added:
scale bullets - scale down sizes if 3 or more players.
make laser tankers spawn in under everything

dead players can play as squadron members - squadron member will spawn if powerup is executed, and take on the player color.

victory Wave: fireworks? Radially spreading bullets?
