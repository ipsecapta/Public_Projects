Below are the sounds I requested relatives to record so I could hook into the game. 
Once a sound was settled on for each of these, I plugged about 3-5 iterations of that sound into the sound manager by making files in Audacity.


Bullet/Firing sounds (8)


A good guy ship shooting a lazer bullet - 
"pew" or or "tshyew" or whatever they come up with for a short sound

a little alien ship shooting a dinky bad guy bullet

a fast fancy alien ship shooting a dinky bad guy bullet

a bigger alien ship shooting big punchy bullets

a HUGE alien ship shooting bullets with a deep sound

a powerful alien laser beam that fires constantly

A super-mega-powerful alien plasma cannon powering up

A super-mega-powerful alien plasma cannon fires



Powerup Sounds(8):


Human orbital MEGA-railgun charging sound

Human orbital MEGA-railgun FIRING sound


What would a shockwave sound like?

What would an EMP sound like, where all the aliens get frozen for a moment?

What would a thousand teeny tiny robots repairing a spaceship sound like?

what about a helpful little spacefighter saying "reporting for duty!" or some hello call like that.

sound effect for energy shield recharging

sound effect for a spaceship leveling up



Impacts/Explosions sounds (8):

a sound where an energy shield takes a hit from a bullet

a sound where an energy shield takes a hit from a BIG bullet


a short explosion sound like a dinky laser bullet hitting metal (like a millisecond pop)(possibly for bullet impacts on characters)

a short explosion, where a bigger laser bullet hits

a bigger explosion sound like two ships colliding

a BIG explosion sound like a ship with lasers going haywire and blowing up!!

What would a big alien  sound like as it blows up? (can have multiple sound embedded)

what would a massive, slow armored alien supership sound like as it blows up?



OPTIONAL(8):
Announcement sounds/sound effects.  Full reign for creativity here.

Starting menu music? Or, just a sound effect for when the game opens.

The gameplay starts -  what would be some good, short, starting announcements?

A wave of enemies is over (happy fanfare? doo-DING? I dunno)

A player ship loses a life (each kid saying something like "I'M HIT!" or "I'm DOWN!" or "I NEED A BREAK!" or "Well there goes a life.")

a player ship respawns -  each kid announcing they're back in the fight, or whatever - can be humorous, serious, whatever they want

a player dies: Each kid saying something for if they lose all their lives... "WOE IS ME" or "MAYDAY MAYDAY" or "I'M GOIN HOME." or whatever


A defeat announcement, or song, for defeat music, for if you lose the game (or whatever they think it should sound like if you lose)

A celebration song, or celebrating sounds, for if you win the game... again, get as creative as you want.
