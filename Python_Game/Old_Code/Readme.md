INDEX
**251215_Pre-AI-Version:** This directory was the final iteration of the game before I began heavier use of GPT 5 and codex for 
	self-education. I deliberately built to this point with the bare minimum consultation only about syntax and 
	some of the mathematics of sprite movement

This was because I wanted to build experience actually working with the code, until I had something functional
	that I understood and could track easily in my mind.
	
In both this and the below subdirectory, there is a text file named _notes_for_development.txt that gives an 
	idea of the sort of syntactical or mathematical questions I was consulting AI with.


**Older_Drafts:** This directory contains an older version of the game, as well as a subdirectory with drafts of the main game
	file from its most basic stages up.  This was my way of doing version control while I was still starting in VSCode
	with no extensions for it.
