- See [Python Game Current Iteration](https://github.com/ipsecapta/Public_Projects/tree/main/Python_Game/Current_Iteration)  for python code and detailed documentation    
- See [Packet Tracer Network README](https://github.com/ipsecapta/Public_Projects/blob/main/Packet_Tracer_Network/README.md) for networking skills and detailed documentation

**REPO INDEX:**


**Python_Game/:** code and media for a multiplayer-capable Space Invaders-style 2D shooter. Subdirectory **Current_Iteration** has latest version. 
  -Began as a capstone assignment for Python studies - see "Final_Classwork_Version" subdirectory for state of game as a class assignment, before 
  integrating AI via Codex / Cursor.
          (at which point it had already far exceeded the requirements of demonstrating basic proficiency - 
          nearly all the code in that subdirectory was manually typed, even when AI was consulted about structure or syntax. Exceptions are noted 
          in the code comments.)
  -All .py files are extensively commented to show comprehension and make navigating what is happening where easier. 
  -See README in that directory for more information. 
  
**Packet_Tracer_Network/:** Capstone project for Networking studies, with detailed readme, scripts and finished .pkt file. 
    -Demonstrates ability with Cisco command line and basic network protocols (DHCP, DNS, VLANs, DTP, NTP, NAT, OSPF, SSH, Syslog; as well as 
    ACL's and IP / IPv6 dual stack addressing.
  -See **README_Detailed** in that directory for a full rundown of all addressing, protocols, and capabilities of that network.
