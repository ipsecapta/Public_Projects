**PACKET_TRACER_NETWORK.pkt:** Virtual network demonstrating proficiency with basic network protocols, ip addressing, 
    ACLs, etc. 

This project demonstrates ability to: 
- Design a VLSM addressing scheme
- Assign IP and IPv6 addressing according to VLSM scheme with full functionality
- Configure VLANs using layer 2 and layer 3 devices; 
- Demonstrate proficiency with basic protocols for configuring network nodes, 
    including DTP, STP, NAT, DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, HSRP, OSPF & OSPFv2 and statically configured routing tables.
- Configure SSH on routers and switches, with best practices around password failure limits, access frequency, 
    and access privilege level.
- Demonstrate ability to configure multiple EtherChannel bundled links, a GRE/VPN tunnel, and a Wireless LAN,
- Configure all VLAN’s, ports, and devices with multiple best-practices security measures like Port Security, 
    BPDUguard, and Access Control Lists, to keep network traffic secure.
- Configure a TFTP server to store saved configurations of devices.
